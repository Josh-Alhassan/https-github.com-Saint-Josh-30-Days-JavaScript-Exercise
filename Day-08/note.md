# OBJECTS - DAY 08

## Scope
A *variable* can be declared at different **scope**. Variable scope can be
+ global
+ local

**note**: *Anything declared without a var, let and const is at global level. Declaring a variable without let or const make it available in window object and this found anywhere*

## Window Object
Declaring a variable without let or const make it available in window object and this can be found anywhere.

## Global scope
A globally declared variable can be accessed every where in the same file. But the term global is reltive. It can be global to the file or it can be relative to some block of codes.
